# ChatterMax

A Magic AI that chats with himself to generate business ideas

## How to run it locally

### Use my Ollama

> That's unlikely to be always running, but that's fun to think that's running

1. `git clone`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run chat`
4. ðŸ˜Ž Enjoy!


### Do it yourself

> At least you do not rely on me

1. `git clone`
2. `docker compose up`
3. `npm i`
4. Change the IP in `chat.js` wrapper to your local thing, most likely `localhost:11434` or something like that
5. `npm run chat`
6. ðŸ˜Ž Enjoy!
