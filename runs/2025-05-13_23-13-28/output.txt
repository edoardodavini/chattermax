Topic: Hyperlocal skill-sharing marketplace connecting neighbors for short-term, in-person lessons and workshops (e.g., guitar lessons, basic coding, bread baking). Users post skills they offer and browse nearby offerings, with a built-in rating and payment system. Focus on fostering community and accessible learning opportunities.
[0] - Normie (Product Manager): Okay, let’s focus on enhancing community engagement. I propose integrating a “skill spotlight” feature – showcasing user talents and fostering connections within the marketplace. This will build trust and encourage participation.
[1] - Guru (Data Scientist): Okay, here’s a solution: Implement a “Skill Spotlight” – a dedicated space for users to showcase their talents and earn recognition. This will boost community engagement and subtly highlight valuable skills, driving organic growth.
Summary. 
Okay, great! Let’s flesh out this “Skill Spotlight” concept further into a strategy for enhancing community engagement. Here’s a revised summary, incorporating your proposal and expanding on the key aspects:

**Summary: Skill Spotlight – Cultivating Community Through Talent Showcase**

**Goal:** To significantly increase user engagement and foster a stronger sense of community around the hyperlocal skill-sharing marketplace, specifically by amplifying individual talent and promoting interaction.

**Current Situation:** Our marketplace currently focuses on facilitating short-term, in-person lessons and workshops. While effective, we’re recognizing the potential to deepen connections beyond just learning and offering a more visible platform for users to share their expertise.

**Proposed Solution: Introducing “Skill Spotlight”**

The Skill Spotlight will be a dedicated, visually-driven space within the marketplace – a dedicated section for users to showcase their skills and gain recognition. This isn’t just about showcasing – it's about fostering genuine connections and building a vibrant neighborhood ecosystem.

**Key Features & Functionality:**

* **User-Generated Content:** Users will be able to easily post a brief description of their skills, including a photo/video, a skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and a price (optional).
* **“Featured Talent” System:** We’ll implement a system to highlight particularly skilled users, earning them a badge/status within the Spotlight. This will be a continuous process, not just a one-time launch.
* **Regular Spotlight Themes:** We’ll introduce themed “Spotlights” – e.g., “Beginner’s Guitar Workshop,” “Coding for Seniors,” “Artisan Bread Baking.” This provides focused content and encourages specific skill categories.
* **Rating & Review System:** Users will be able to rate and review each other’s skills and offers, building trust and accountability within the marketplace. A ‘recommended’ button will further boost visibility.
* **Community Challenges & Contests:**  Periodically, we'll host small challenges or contests related to specific skills – sparking creativity and engagement.
* **Direct Connection Opportunities:**  The platform will include tools to help users easily connect with each other based on their Skill Spotlight showcases – facilitating real-world learning & mentoring opportunities.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* **Increased User Participation:**  Users will be motivated to actively showcase their talents.
* **Enhanced Community:**  The Spotlight will create a space for users to interact, learn from each other, and build relationships.
* **Organic Growth:**  Increased visibility through the Spotlight will lead to more user sign-ups and activity.
* **Valuable Content:** The Spotlight will provide a valuable opportunity for users to showcase their expertise and earn recognition, enhancing the marketplace’s reputation.


**Next Steps:** We’ll conduct user research and testing on this concept to refine the feature and ensure it aligns with our overall community goals.
